## PART ONE ##

In the previous assignment on Web Application Development, you used the SVG logo (http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/ds/logo.svg) of Dunedin Dairy.

The logo consists of a machine-generated SVG <path> to represent simple shapes. This is not ideal. Not only this <path> is difficult to comprehend, but also it makes changes difficult (can you see any other cons?).<br/> <br/> 
Consequently, you are asked to re-do the logo using appropriate high-level SVG objects other than <path>s (e.g., <rect>s, <circle>s). Your revised logo should be almost identical to the current logo.

You need to do the logo by hand â€” that is, you are not allowed to use a design tool such as Inkscape.

## PART TWO ##

Professor Willow discovered that Dunedin Dairy is conducting some secret research. He spotted an undocumented endpoint in their backend and wants your help in his investigation. <br/> <br/> 
The endpoint is this: http://redsox.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/ds/DairyService.svc/g . 
Professor Willow thinks it is an adjaceny matrix of a graph, and wants you to help visualize the graph.

To this end, write a single-page web application that consumes this adjaceny matrix, and renders the corresponding graph in SVG format. <br/> <br/> 
For verification, include the source matrix below the graph.
